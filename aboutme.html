    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> I am working towards fulfilling my goals in my personal life. In my professional life I am working towards success. The experiences that led me here were values from my family. I am working towards these goals by hard work and making sure that I am ready for working. I am making sure that I am ready to succeed in all aspects of life. The values I consider most necessary for my success is determination and perseverance. I will make sure that I always finish whatever I'm doing.  The short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future are learning Spanish and getting job experience. I want to learn Spanish because it is a major language and will help me communicate with much more people. I want to get job experience to find out what I am best at. I want to be known for my great amount of determination.</p>
